# cantropee-frontend

cantropee is a finance web application for managing multiple virtual accounts.

The `cantropee-frontend` component in this repository is the web frontend, utilizing [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

This was more of a learning project to dive into
Vue.js than anything else.
I did not know about `vue-router` or `pinia` at the time. I started adding pinia before
abandoning this project for the time being, but did not really get anywhere with it.
Please don't judge me :D
